Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. Import necessary libraries (Scikit-learn)
2. Load iris dataset (X = features, y = target variable)
3. Split data into training (80%) and testing sets (20%)
4. Train and evaluate two models:
    - Logistic Regression (logreg)
    - Random Forest Classifier (rf)
5. Print evaluation metrics for each model:
    - Accuracy
    - Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)
    - Confusion Matrix (true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives)

This code compares the performance of two AI models on the iris dataset, helping you choose the best model for classification tasks.
